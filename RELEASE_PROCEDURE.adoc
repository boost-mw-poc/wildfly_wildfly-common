# Release Procedure

WildFly Common is released in JBoss Nexus Repository

To release a new version, follow the instructions:

```
git checkout --detach

mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=<release version>
git commit -am 'Prep <release version>'
git tag -a -m <release version> <release version>
mvn clean install && mvn deploy -Pjboss-release -DaltDeploymentRepository=jboss-releases-repository::https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/service/local/staging/deploy/maven2
```

If the deployment to Nexus is successful, you can continue with:

```
git checkout main (or the release branch)
mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=<next version>-SNAPSHOT
git commit -am 'Next is <next version>'
git push upstream <tag> <branch> --dry-run
```

At this point, release the artifacts in Nexus.

Finally, push the commits to GitHub:

```
git push upstream <tag> <branch>
```

Once the artifacts are in Nexus and the tag is pushed to GitHub, the last step is to create the Release Notes in https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-common/releases[GitHub Releases] from the new tag.
